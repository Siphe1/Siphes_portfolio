# Siphe Mbonambi - Data Analysis Portfolio
## About
Hi, I am Siphe. I am currently on my second and final year of my Master's degree in Applied Data Science from the University of Johannesburg. I am an expereinced analytics consultant in the financial services industry where I leverage data-driven insight to solve business challenges. I also hold an honours degree in Marketing from the University of Witwaterstrand which has helped me create a strong foundation in understanding customer behaviour, market trends and business strategy. I have strong domain knowledge in financial services. During my Masters I have been able to develop skills in SQL, Python, Machine Learning, Power BI and Advanced Data Analysis techniques to deliver impactful solution. I am passionate about combining my technical expertise and business knowlowledge to solve business problems and provide actionable insight.

## Portfolio Projects
In the below section I will list some of my data analytics projects a give a brief discription of the technology used in order to analyse the data.

## Analysing the toys dataset in order to gain any useful insight that could help grow the industry

**Code**: [`Analysis on the toys dataset`](https://github.com/Siphe1/Siphes_portfolio/blob/main/Toys_Sales_Project_.ipynb)

**Goal**: To analyse the data to find any patterns and possible opportunities that can be used to boast sales.

**Description**: The project is focused on analysing the toys sales dataset from January 2022 to July 2023. Though the time period is short we want to see if there is any insight that can be discovered from it. We will merge together the sales dataset, the products dataset and the store dataset. We will then perform some data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis and lastly ask some business questions that will help us get insight from the data.

**Skills**: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualisations.

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Results**: Some of the things we learned from our analysis is that December is the month with the highest profits which adds up as it is christmas and a lot of toys are bought in that season. We could boast new toy ranges that are only avaiable in this season in order to further boast profits with limited edition products.
We noticed that Downtown stores are the most profitable locations by a huge margin with airport being the lowest. We could try boast the airport sales as they have a lot of foot traffic and when people travel love to buy souvenirs so we could try implement those type of products to the stores. We were also able to identify that the Dino Egg has the lowest profit margin and we could look into the impact of increasing it's price in order to gain a higher profit margin without impacting how many are sold. Lastly we noticed that Colorbuds was the most sold products with peak sales being in summer of 01-2022. There has been a steady drop though of the total unit sales of the product and a solution needs to be found to why the highest sold products is dropping unit sales consistently through the months.





## Using the service sales dataset in order to predict if people will subsribe to the offered digital services 

**Code**: ['Predicting subsriptions of digital service'](https://github.com/Siphe1/Siphes_portfolio/blob/main/Subscription%20Prediction%20Project.ipynb)

**Goal**: To create a machine learning model that can predict if a client will subsribe to offered services based on their demographic, economic and behavioural data.

**Description**: 

**Skills**: Data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Machine Learning

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
